Your credit score is one of the most important factors lenders consider when evaluating your loan application. A higher score can mean the difference between getting approved at a great rate or being turned down altogether.

## Why Your Credit Score Matters

Lenders use your credit score to assess how likely you are to repay a loan. The higher your score, the lower the risk you represent, which typically translates to:

- **Better interest rates** - Save thousands over the life of your loan
- **Higher loan amounts** - Qualify for the full amount you need
- **Faster approvals** - Streamlined application process
- **More loan options** - Access to premium loan products

## 5 Ways to Boost Your Credit Score

### 1. Pay Your Bills on Time, Every Time

Payment history accounts for 35% of your credit score calculation. Even one late payment can negatively impact your score for years.

**Action Steps:**
- Set up automatic payments for at least the minimum amount
- Use calendar reminders for due dates
- Pay bills a few days early to account for processing time

### 2. Keep Your Credit Utilization Low

Try to use less than 30% of your available credit limit, but ideally keep it under 10% for the best impact on your score.

**Example:** If you have a $10,000 credit limit, keep your balance below $1,000.

### 3. Don't Close Old Credit Cards

The length of your credit history makes up 15% of your score. Keeping old accounts open (even if you don't use them) helps maintain a longer average account age.

### 4. Limit New Credit Applications

Each hard inquiry can temporarily lower your score by a few points. Only apply for credit when you truly need it.

### 5. Check Your Credit Report Regularly

Look for errors and dispute any inaccuracies with the credit reporting agencies. You're entitled to one free credit report per year from each bureau.

## How Long Does It Take to See Results?

- **Payment history improvements**: 1-2 months
- **Credit utilization changes**: 1-2 billing cycles  
- **New accounts/inquiries**: 3-6 months to see positive impact
- **Major improvements**: 6-12 months with consistent effort
