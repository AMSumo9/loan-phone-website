## What Is Asset Finance?

Asset finance allows businesses to acquire essential assets without large upfront payments. Instead, you can spread the cost over time while using the asset to generate revenue for your business. This preserves working capital and improves cash flow management.

## Types of Assets We Finance

### Commercial Vehicles & Fleet
From single vehicles to entire fleets, including trucks, vans, cars, and specialized vehicles for your industry.

### Office & Retail Fit-Outs
Complete fit-outs for offices, retail stores, restaurants, and other commercial spaces including furniture, fixtures, and equipment.

### Technology & IT Equipment
Computers, servers, point-of-sale systems, software, and other technology essential for modern business operations.

### Manufacturing & Production Equipment
Machinery, production lines, specialized equipment, and tools needed for manufacturing and production businesses.

### Construction & Heavy Equipment
Excavators, bulldozers, cranes, and other heavy machinery for construction, mining, and infrastructure projects.

### Medical & Healthcare Equipment
Specialized medical equipment, diagnostic tools, and healthcare technology for medical practices and facilities.

## Asset Finance Structures

### Chattel Mortgage
Own the asset from day one while claiming tax benefits. Popular for vehicles and equipment where ownership is important.

### Finance Lease
Lower monthly payments with flexibility at the end of the term. The financier owns the asset during the lease period.

### Operating Lease
Off-balance-sheet financing that can offer tax advantages and the flexibility to upgrade equipment regularly.

### Sale and Leaseback
Sell existing assets to a financier and lease them back to unlock capital while retaining use of the assets.

## Benefits of Asset Finance

### Preserve Working Capital
Keep your cash for day-to-day operations while still acquiring the assets you need to grow your business.

### Tax Advantages
Depending on the structure, you may be able to claim depreciation, lease payments, or interest as tax deductions.

### Flexible Terms
Choose repayment terms and structures that align with your cash flow and business cycle.

### Stay Current with Technology
Leasing arrangements can provide options to upgrade to newer technology and equipment as it becomes available.
