## When Short-Term Loans Make Sense

Short-term loans are designed for situations where you need quick access to funds for a specific purpose, with the intention of repaying the loan within a relatively short timeframe.

## Common Uses for Short-Term Loans

### Business Cash Flow Management
Cover operational expenses while waiting for invoices to be paid or seasonal revenue to arrive.

### Emergency Expenses
Handle unexpected costs such as urgent repairs, medical bills, or other unforeseen expenses that can't wait.

### Opportunity Funding
Secure quick funding to take advantage of time-sensitive business opportunities or investments.

### Bridging Finance
Bridge the gap between buying and selling property, or between different phases of a project.

## What to Consider

### Repayment Timeline
Short-term loans typically have repayment terms from a few weeks to 12 months. Consider your ability to repay within this timeframe.

### Cost vs Benefit
While short-term loans may have higher interest rates, they can be cost-effective when the alternative is missing an opportunity or facing penalties.

### Purpose and Planning
Ensure you have a clear plan for how you'll repay the loan and that the funding serves a specific, beneficial purpose.
