# Why Choose The Loan Phone for New Car Finance?

When you're ready to buy a new car, the last thing you want is to be stuck with the first finance offer you see. Car yards often have relationships with specific lenders, which means you might not be getting the most competitive rate available.

## Compare Before You Buy

Our service gives you access to a panel of lenders before you even step foot in a dealership. This means you can:

- **Shop with confidence** knowing your maximum budget
- **Negotiate better** with pre-approved finance in hand  
- **Save money** by comparing multiple lenders' offers
- **Avoid dealer markups** on finance rates

## What We Can Finance

Our lenders provide finance for:

- **New passenger vehicles** - sedans, hatchbacks, SUVs, and wagons
- **New commercial vehicles** - utes, vans, and light trucks
- **Motorcycles and recreational vehicles** - bikes, boats, and caravans
- **Electric and hybrid vehicles** - with some lenders offering special green rates

## The Application Process

Getting pre-approved for your new car loan is straightforward:

1. **Tell us about your loan needs** - amount, term, and vehicle type
2. **Provide basic financial information** - income, expenses, and employment details
3. **Receive your pre-approval** - usually within 24 hours
4. **Shop for your car** with confidence in your budget
5. **Finalise your loan** once you've found the perfect vehicle

## Tips for Getting the Best Rate

- **Check your credit score** before applying
- **Save a deposit** - even 10% can improve your rate
- **Consider the total loan cost** not just the monthly payment
- **Choose a realistic loan term** that fits your budget
- **Keep your financial documents** up to date
