## Why Used Car Finance Makes Sense

Used cars offer great value, but financing them can be more complex than financing a new vehicle. Different lenders have different criteria for vehicle age, mileage, and condition. Our expertise helps you navigate these requirements.

## What We Can Finance

### Dealer Vehicles
Cars from licensed dealers typically come with warranties and detailed histories, making them easier to finance with competitive rates.

### Private Sale Vehicles
We work with lenders who specialize in private sale financing, helping you secure the car you want regardless of where you're buying it.

### Older Vehicles
Even if your chosen car is several years old, we have lenders who understand the value in well-maintained older vehicles.

### Classic & Vintage Cars
For classic car enthusiasts, we can connect you with specialist lenders who understand the unique value of vintage vehicles.

## Benefits of Pre-Approved Finance

### Negotiating Power
Walk into any negotiation with the confidence of knowing your budget and having finance already arranged.

### Faster Purchase Process
Skip the dealer's finance office and complete your purchase faster with pre-arranged funding.

### Compare Real Options
See what you can actually borrow and at what rates before you start shopping for your perfect car.

## What Affects Used Car Loan Rates?

### Vehicle Age & Condition
Newer used cars typically attract better rates, but we work with lenders across all vehicle ages.

### Loan Amount & Term
The amount you borrow and repayment term can affect your rate - our brokers will help optimize both.

### Your Credit Profile
Your credit history affects available options, but we work with lenders who consider various credit profiles.

### Employment & Income
Stable employment and income help secure better rates - we'll help present your application in the best light.

## Ready to Finance Your Used Car?

Don't let financing complexity slow down your car purchase. Get pre-approved and drive away with confidence in your deal.
