        <p>At Loan Phone, we are committed to protecting your privacy regarding any information we collect from you across our website, <a href="https://www.loanphone.com.au" class="underline text-blue-600">https://www.loanphone.com.au</a> and other sites we operate. By providing personal information to us, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Policy and any other arrangements that apply between us.</p>
        <p>Loan Phone is committed to complying with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), the Australian Privacy Principles and any other relevant laws when handling your personal information. A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner at <a href="https://www.aoic.gov.au" class="underline text-blue-600">www.aoic.gov.au</a></p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-6">INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
        <p>We may request personal details, such as your name, phone number and email address. This "identifying information" can be used to personally identify you. We may ask for other information to assess the your suitability for products you have enquired about. We only ask for information that is relevant to providing the services you request and use it solely to support or enhance those services.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-6">HOW DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We collect information using fair and transparent methods, with your awareness and consent. We make it clear why we are gathering the data and how it will be utilized. You have the right to refuse our request for information; however, declining may limit our ability to provide certain services to you.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-6">WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT VIA YOUR ONLINE ACTIVITY</h2>
        <p>If you’re an internet customer of ours, we may monitor your use of internet services to ensure we can verify you and can receive information from us, and to identify ways we can improve our services for you. If you start but don’t submit all the information we request, we can contact you using any of the contact details you’ve supplied to offer help completing it.</p>
        <p>We also know that some customers like to engage with us through social media channels. We may collect information about you when you interact with us through these channels. However, for all confidential matters, we’ll ensure we interact with you by via a secure forum.</p>
        <p>To improve our services and products, we sometimes collect de-identified information from web users. That information could include IP addresses or geographical information to ensure your use of our web applications is secure.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-6">HOW WE COLLECT & USE INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We combine identifying and non-identifying information to understand our users better, how they engage with our services, and how we can improve their experience on our site. While we may share general trends and anonymized data, we do not publicly disclose specific details of this information.</p>
        <p>Unless it’s unreasonable or impracticable, we will try to collect personal information directly from you. For this reason, it’s important that you help us to do this and keep your contact details up-to-date.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-6">HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, we will collect information about you from other sources as the Privacy Act 1988 permits. We will do this only if it’s reasonably necessary to do so, for example, where we collect information from third parties about the loan or lease made available to you arising out of the services we provide you; we can’t get hold of you and we rely on public information to update your contact details; or we exchange information with advisers or other representatives we introduce you to as part of our service.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-6">SENSITIVE INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>Sensitive information is any information about a person’s racial or ethnic origin, membership of a political association, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical benefits, membership of a professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, sexual preferences or practices, criminal record or health information. We will not ask you to disclose sensitive information, but if you elect to provide sensitive information it will be captured and stored.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-6">WHAT ARE THE MAIN REASONS WE COLLECT & STORE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>Collecting your personal information allows us to provide you with the products and services you’ve asked for. This means we can use your information to: match you with professionals who may be able to assist with services you have enquired about; introduce you to professionals who may be able to assist you with services you have enquired about; match and introduce you to products, services and vendors who may be able to assist you; administer services we provide, for example, to answer requests or deal with complaints; and administer payments we receive, relating to transactions you participate in with us or parties we introduce to you.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-6">CAN WE USE YOUR INFORMATION FOR MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS & SERVICES?</h2>
        <p>We may use or disclose your personal information to put you in contact with Third Parties regarding the services you enquired about including including sharing with Finance and Mortgage Brokers who provide services related to your enquiry. We may use or disclose your personal information to let you know about other products or services we or a Third party make available and that may be of interest to you.</p>
        <p>You can let us know at any time if you no longer wish to receive direct marketing offers from us. We will process your request as soon as practicable. You may opt out at any time by sending a text message "DELETE" to 0440 135 626</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-6">SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We may use and share your information with other organisations for any purpose described above. This may include sharing with your representatives (e.g., lawyers, accountants) and third parties such as mortgage aggregators, referrers, lenders, fraud reporting agencies, government bodies, and our own service providers.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-6">UPDATES TO THIS POLICY</h2>
        <p>We may revise this policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices. If we make updates, we will notify users via our website. Your continued use of our site and services after policy updates constitutes your agreement to the revised terms.</p>
